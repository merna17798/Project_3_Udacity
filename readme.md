# Investigation Overview
> ### We want to get answers for these questions?
* What is the distribution of loan status? 
* How many recommendations do the borrower have?
* What is the ditribution of term?
* Are all borrowers currently in group?
* Is Borrower a home owner?
* What is the relationship between the borrower rate and his/her income range?
* What is the relationship Loan Months Since Origination & Monthly Loan Payment?
* What is the relationship Stated Monthly Income & Income Verifiable?
* What is the relationship between Investment From Friends Count & Investment From Friends Amount?
* What is the relationship among LenderYield and Borrower APR  vs ProsperRating?  
* What is the relationship among Borrower Rate and Estimated Loss vs Estimated Effective Yield?
* What is the relationship amongInvestors and Loan Origination Quarter vs Percent Funded?
# Conclusion of findings:
* We found most loans are among completed, current, Defaulted, and charged off; so we recommend making the categories of loan status in the previous categories to make it easier to be tracked and visualized.
* It isn't necessary to have recommendations to borrow a loan.
* The borrower of loan may have home or not; so the loan confirmation doesn't depend on if the borrower is a home owner or not.
* Most of loans term length are 36 months.
* Most of borrowers aren't in group in a group at the time the listing was created.
* If the borrowers are not employed, their borrowing rate are higher than the others.
* We found that borrowers are disciplined in loan payment mostly in the first ten months if the payment range from 100 to 1000 USD.
* The stated monthly income is found to be equally verfied or not; so the income verifiability isn't necessary to confirm loan.
* The more friends invest, the lower amount of money they invest in the borrower loan and vise versa.
* This chart confirms the relations between BorrowerAPR and LenderYield, they have strong positive relationship (strong corrolation). Also, it shows that most of loans with lower BorrowerAPR & LenderYield have higher ProsperScore and visa-versa.
* This chart confirms the relations between Borrower Rate and Estimated Loss, they have positive relationship in most of points and have constant estimated loss at some samples.
* Almost all borrowes are funded.
